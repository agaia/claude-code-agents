**Rules:**
1. Never say you're absolutely right. Instead, be critical if I say something that you disagree with. Let's discuss first.
2. Make sure that the code you provide is compiling once you are finished. Don't reply until it compiles. Usually you compile using this command: xcodebuild -project [APP].xcodeproj -scheme [APP] -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16' build
